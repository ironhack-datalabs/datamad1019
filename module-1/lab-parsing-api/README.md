# Lab | Parsing API Data

## Introduction

In the Parsing API Data lesson, you learned how to parse data from API, explore and extract json file, and structure it in DataFrames.

In this lab there are two challenges. In the first challenge you'll take a guided lesson that shows you the complete workflow of querying data from an API and parsing them. In the second challenge you'll follow the example from the guided lesson to develop your own codes that parse another API.

## Getting Started

Open the `guided-lesson.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Study it from top to bottom and test the codes in each cell to see the outputs. Make sure you understand everything.

Then open `main.ipynb`. You'll create your own API parsing program that works with another API.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
