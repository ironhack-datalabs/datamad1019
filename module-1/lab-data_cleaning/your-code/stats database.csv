<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>

<p>I am a self-taught programmer mainly involved in <strong>PHP, MySQL, CSS/HTML, JavaScript/jQuery</strong> for around 4 years now. I have also worked with ASP 3.0, Java and PERL quite a bit. I like to code and develop in accordance with XHTML/CSS/Web standards, validated and cross-browser ready sites. I simply love PHP, JavaScript, JQuery and CSS. I  like to use state-of-the-art tools and techs and keep myself updated with latest stuff and am therefore always keen to learn new things and gain more and more knowledge because the thirst is <em>never</em> satisfied :)</p>

<p>I believe that there is some answer to any question. It is not the task of the users here to lecture others or criticize them for laziness or stupidity. There is little educational value in sarcasm. </p>

<p>If a question is badly formulated, one can give advice on how to do better. </p>

<p>If important information is missing, one can kindly ask for it. </p>

<p>Someone else being unfriendly or badly mannered is no justification for being so yourself.</p>

<p>Using a Dell Alienware laptop Quad-core system with 24 GB RAM and running Windows 8.1 Ultimate 64-bits plus an Alienware desktop PC with 6 cores, 32 GB RAM running Windows 8.1 Professional 64-bits with two 1920x1200 monitors to develop my own desktop applications, my own C# web applications, my own Python Apps for Google and for maintaining several of my own websites and domains. This is all just pure a hobby.  </p>

<p>BTW, I'm also a bit of an amateur at creating interesting CGI artwork, which basically means that I'm still keeping my art very simple. Less objects in the image generally means the rendering will be simpler and faster so as a result, some of my art is NSFW. Most is more like my gravatar. And some is pretty decent. :-) </p>
