# Who am I
I am from Madrid, I just finish studying Biomedical Engineering in Universidad Carlos III, and last year I spent 6 months in an internship program in a web development company where I learned to program in C, C++ and C#. There, I realized how much I enjoy programming. I am really looking forward these two months in Iron Hack !!!
