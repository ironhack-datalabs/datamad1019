      "PROPHET  Almustafa chosen  beloved who was dawn unto his own  day had waited twelve years in city  of Orphalese for his ship that was to  return bear him back to isle of  his birth And in twelfth year on seventh  day of Ielool month of reaping he  climbed hill without city walls  and looked seaward he beheld his  ship coming with mist Then gates of his heart were flung  open his joy flew far over sea And he closed his eyes prayed in  silences of his soul But as he descended hill sadness  came upon him he thought in his  heart How shall I go in peace without  sorrow Nay not without wound in  spirit shall I leave this city Long  were days of pain I have spent  within its walls long were  nights of aloneness who can depart  from his pain his aloneness without  regret Too many fragments of spirit have I  scattered in these streets too many  are children of my longing that walk  naked among these hills I cannot  withdraw from them without burden  an ache It is not garment I cast off this  day but skin that I tear with my own  hands Nor is it thought I leave behind me but heart made sweet with hunger  with thirst Yet I cannot tarry longer The sea that calls all things unto her  calls me I must embark For to stay though hours burn in  the night is to freeze crystallize  and be bound in mould Fain would I take with me all that is  here But how shall I A voice cannot carry tongue  the lips that gave it wings Alone  must it seek ether And alone without his nest shall  eagle fly across sun Now when he reached foot of  hill he turned again towards sea and he saw his ship approaching  harbour upon her prow mariners the men of his own land And his soul cried out to them he  said Sons of my ancient mother you riders of  the tides How often have you sailed in my dreams And now you come in my awakening which  is my deeper dream Ready am I to go my eagerness with  sails full set awaits wind Only another breath will I breathe in  this still air only another loving look  cast backward And then I shall stand among you  seafarer among seafarers And you vast sea sleepless mother Who alone are peace freedom to  river stream Only another winding will this stream  make only another murmur in this glade And then shall I come to you  boundless drop to boundless ocean And as he walked he saw from afar men  and women leaving their fields their  vineyards hastening towards city  gates And he heard their voices calling his  name shouting from field to field  telling one another of coming of his  ship And he said to himself Shall day of parting be day of  gathering And shall it be said that my eve was in  truth my dawn And what shall I give unto him who has  left his plough in midfurrow or to  him who has stopped wheel of his  winepress Shall my heart become  tree heavy laden with fruit that I may  gather give unto them And shall my desires flow like  fountain that I may fill their cups Am I harp that hand of mighty  may touch me or flute that his breath  may pass through me A seeker of silences am I what  treasure have I found in silences that I  may dispense with confidence If this is my day of harvest in what  fields have I sowed seed in  what unremembered seasons If this indeed be hour in which I  lift up my lantern it is not my flame  that shall burn therein Empty dark shall I raise my lantern And guardian of night shall fill  it with oil he shall light it also These things he said in words But much  in his heart remained unsaid For he  himself could not speak his deeper  secret Illustration And when he entered into city all  the people came to meet him they  were crying out to him as with one  voice And elders of city stood forth  and said Go not yet away from us A noontide have you been in our  twilight your youth has given us  dreams to dream No stranger are you among us nor  a guest but our son our dearly  beloved Suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for  your face And priests priestesses said  unto him Let not waves of sea separate us  now years you have spent in our  midst become memory You have walked among us spirit and your shadow has been light  upon our faces Much have we loved you But speechless  was our love with veils has it been  veiled Yet now it cries aloud unto you  would stand revealed before you And ever has it been that love knows  not its own depth until hour of  separation And others came also entreated him But he answered them not He only bent  his head those who stood near saw  his tears falling upon his breast And he people proceeded towards  the great square before temple And there came out of sanctuary  woman whose name was Almitra And she  was seeress And he looked upon her with exceeding  tenderness for it was she who had first  sought believed in him when he had  been but day in their city And  she hailed him saying Prophet of God in quest of  uttermost long have you searched  distances for your ship And now your ship has come you must  needs go Deep is your longing for land of  your memories dwelling place  of your greater desires our love  would not bind you nor our needs hold  you Yet this we ask ere you leave us that  you speak to us give us of your  truth And we will give it unto our children and they unto their children it  shall not perish In your aloneness you have watched with  our days in your wakefulness you  have listened to weeping  laughter of our sleep Now therefore disclose us to ourselves and tell us all that has been shown  you of that which is between birth  death And he answered People of Orphalese of what can I  speak save of that which is even now  moving within your souls Then said Almitra Speak to us of  Love And he raised his head looked upon  the people there fell stillness  upon them And with great voice he  said When love beckons to you follow him Though his ways are hard steep And when his wings enfold you yield to  him Though sword hidden among his  pinions may wound you And when he speaks to you believe in  him Though his voice may shatter your dreams  as north wind lays waste garden For even as love crowns you so shall  he crucify you Even as he is for your  growth so is he for your pruning Even as he ascends to your height  caresses your tenderest branches  that quiver in sun So shall he descend to your roots  shake them in their clinging to  earth Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto  himself He threshes you to make you naked He sifts you to free you from your  husks He grinds you to whiteness He kneads you until you are pliant And then he assigns you to his sacred  fire that you may become sacred bread  for God s sacred feast All these things shall love do unto you  that you may know secrets of your  heart in that knowledge become  fragment of Life s heart But if in your fear you would seek only  love s peace love s pleasure Then it is better for you that you  cover your nakedness pass out of  love s threshing floor Into seasonless world where you  shall laugh but not all of your  laughter weep but not all of your  tears Love gives naught but itself takes  naught but from itself Love possesses not nor would it be  possessed For love is sufficient unto love When you love you should not say God  is in my heart but rather I am in  the heart of God And think not you can direct course  of love for love if it finds you  worthy directs your course Love has no other desire but to fulfil  itself But if you love must needs have  desires let these be your desires To melt be like running brook that  sings its melody to night To  know pain of too much tenderness To be wounded by your own understanding  of love And to bleed willingly joyfully To wake at dawn with winged heart  give thanks for another day of loving To rest at noon hour meditate  love s ecstacy To return home at eventide with  gratitude And then to sleep with prayer for  the beloved in your heart song of  praise upon your lips Illustration  Then Almitra spoke again said And what of Marriage master And he answered saying You were born together together you  shall be forevermore You shall be together when white  wings of death scatter your days Aye you shall be together even in  silent memory of God But let there be spaces in your  togetherness And let winds of heavens dance  between you Love one another but make not bond of  love Let it rather be moving sea between  the shores of your souls Fill each other s cup but drink not from  one cup Give one another of your bread but eat  not from same loaf Sing  dance together be joyous but let  each one of you be alone Even as strings of lute are alone  though they quiver with same music Give your hearts but not into each  other s keeping For only hand of Life can contain  your hearts And stand together yet not too near  together For pillars of temple stand  apart And oak tree cypress grow  not in each other s shadow Illustration  And woman who held babe  against her bosom said Speak to us of  Children And he said Your children are not your children They are sons daughters of  Life s longing for itself They come through you but not from you And though they are with you yet they  belong not to you You may give them your love but not your  thoughts For they have their own thoughts You may house their bodies but not their  souls For their souls dwell in house of  tomorrow which you cannot visit not  even in your dreams You may strive to be like them but seek  not to make them like you For  life goes not backward nor tarries with  yesterday You are bows from which your  children as living arrows are sent  forth The archer sees mark upon path  of infinite He bends you with  His might that His arrows may go swift  and far Let your bending in Archer s hand be  for gladness For even as he loves arrow that  flies so He loves also bow that is  stable Then said rich man Speak to us of  Giving And he answered You give but little when you give of  your possessions It is when you give of yourself that you  truly give For what are your possessions but things  you keep guard for fear you may need  them tomorrow And tomorrow what shall tomorrow bring  to overprudent dog burying bones  in trackless sand as he follows  pilgrims to holy city And what is fear of need but need  itself Is not dread of thirst when your well is  full thirst that is unquenchable There are those who give little of  much which they have and they give  it for recognition their hidden  desire makes their gifts unwholesome And there are those who have little  give it all These are believers in life  the bounty of life their coffer is  never empty There are those who give with joy  that joy is their reward And there are those who give with pain and that pain is their baptism And there are those who give know  not pain in giving nor do they seek  joy nor give with mindfulness of  virtue They give as in yonder valley myrtle  breathes its fragrance into space Through hands of such as these God  speaks from behind their eyes He  smiles upon earth Illustration It is well to give when asked but it  is better to give unasked through  understanding And to open handed search for  one who shall receive is joy greater  than giving And is there aught you would withhold All you have shall some day be given Therefore give now that season  of giving may be yours not your  inheritors You often say I would give but only  to deserving The trees in your orchard say not so nor flocks in your pasture They give that they may live for to  withhold is to perish Surely he who is worthy to receive his  days his nights is worthy of all  else from you And he who has deserved to drink from  the ocean of life deserves to fill his  cup from your little stream And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in courage  and confidence nay charity of  receiving And who are you that men should rend  their bosom unveil their pride that you may see their worth naked  their pride unabashed See first that you yourself deserve to  be giver instrument of giving For in truth it is life that gives unto  life while you who deem yourself  giver are but witness And you receivers and you are  all receivers assume no weight of  gratitude lest you lay yoke upon  yourself upon him who gives Rather rise together with giver on  his gifts as on wings For to be overmindful of your debt is  ito doubt his generosity who has  freehearted earth for mother God  for father Illustration  Then old man keeper of  inn said Speak to us of Eating  Drinking And he said Would that you could live on  fragrance of earth like air  plant be sustained by light But since you must kill to eat rob  the newly born of its mother s milk to  quench your thirst let it then be  act of worship And let your board stand altar on  which pure innocent of  forest plain are sacrificed for that  which is purer still more innocent  in man When you kill beast say to him in your  heart By same power that slays you I too  am slain I too shall be consumed For law that delivered you into  my hand shall deliver me into mightier  hand Your blood my blood is naught but  the sap that feeds tree of heaven And when you crush apple with your  teeth say to it in your heart Your seeds shall live in my body And buds of your tomorrow shall  blossom in my heart And your fragrance shall be my breath And together we shall rejoice through  all seasons And in autumn when you gather  the grapes of your vineyards for  winepress say in your heart I too am vineyard my fruit shall  be gathered for winepress And like new wine I shall be kept in  eternal vessels And in winter when you draw wine let there be in your heart song  for each cup And let there be in song  remembrance for autumn days for  the vineyard for winepress Then ploughman said Speak  to us of Work And he answered saying You work that you may keep pace with  earth soul of earth For to be idle is to become stranger  unto seasons to step out of  life s procession that marches in  majesty proud submission towards  infinite When you work you are flute through  whose heart whispering of hours  turns to music Which of you would be reed dumb  silent when all else sings together in  unison Always you have been told that work is  curse labour misfortune But I say to you that when you work you  fulfil part of earth s furthest dream assigned to you when that dream was  born And in keeping yourself with labour you  are in truth loving life And to love life through labour is to be  intimate with life s inmost secret But if you in your pain call birth  affliction support of flesh  a curse written upon your brow then I  answer that naught but sweat of  your brow shall wash away that which is  written You have been told also that life is  darkness in your weariness you echo  what was said by weary And I say that life is indeed darkness  save when there is urge And all urge is blind save when there is  knowledge And all knowledge is vain save when  there is work And all work is empty save when there is  love And when you work with love you bind  yourself to yourself to one  another to God And what is it to work with love It is to weave cloth with threads  drawn from your heart even as if your  beloved were to wear that cloth It is to build house with affection even as if your beloved were to dwell in  that house It is to sow seeds with tenderness  reap harvest with joy even as if  your beloved were to eat fruit It is to charge all things you fashion  with breath of your own spirit And to know that all blessed dead  are standing about you watching Often have I heard you say as if  speaking in sleep He who works in  marble finds shape of his own  soul in stone is nobler than he who  ploughs soil And he who seizes  the rainbow to lay it on cloth in  likeness of man is more than he who  makes sandals for our feet But I say not in sleep but in  overwakefulness of noontide that  wind speaks not more sweetly to  giant oaks than to least of all  blades of grass And he alone is great who turns  voice of wind into song made  sweeter by his own loving Work is love made visible And if you cannot work with love but  only with distaste it is better that  you should leave your work sit at  the gate of temple take alms of  those who work with joy For if you bake bread with indifference you bake bitter bread that feeds but  half man s hunger And if you grudge crushing of  grapes your grudge distils poison in  the wine And if you sing though as  angels love not singing you  muffle man s ears to voices of  day voices of night Then woman said Speak to us of  Joy Sorrow And he answered Your joy is your sorrow unmasked And selfsame well from which your  laughter rises was oftentimes filled  with your tears And how else can it be The deeper that sorrow carves into your  being more joy you can contain Is not cup that holds your wine  very cup that was burned in potter s  oven And is not lute that soothes your  spirit very wood that was hollowed  with knives When you are joyous look deep into your  heart you shall find it is only  that which has given you sorrow that is  giving you joy When you are sorrowful look again in  your heart you shall see that  in truth you are weeping for that which  has been your delight Some of you say Joy is greater than  sorrow others say Nay sorrow is  the greater But I say unto you they are  inseparable Together they come when one sits  alone with you at your board remember  that other is asleep upon your bed Verily you are suspended like scales  between your sorrow your joy Only when you are empty are you at  standstill balanced When treasure keeper lifts you to  weigh his gold his silver needs  must your joy or your sorrow rise or  fall Then mason came forth said Speak to us of Houses And he answered said Build of your imaginings bower in  wilderness ere you build house within  the city walls For even as you have home comings in  your twilight so has wanderer in  you ever distant alone Your house is your larger body It grows in sun sleeps in  stillness of night it is not  dreamless Does not your house dream and dreaming leave city for grove  or hilltop Would that I could gather your houses  into my hand like sower scatter  them in forest meadow Would valleys were your streets  the green paths your alleys that you  might seek one another through  vineyards come with fragrance  of earth in your garments But these things are not yet to be In their fear your forefathers gathered  you too near together And that fear  shall endure little longer A little  longer shall your city walls separate  your hearths from your fields And tell me people of Orphalese what  have you in these houses And what is it  you guard with fastened doors Have you peace quiet urge that  reveals your power Have you remembrances glimmering  arches that span summits of  mind Have you beauty that leads heart  from things fashioned of wood stone  to holy mountain Tell me have you these in your houses Or have you only comfort lust  for comfort that stealthy thing that  enters house guest then  becomes host then master Ay it becomes tamer with  hook scourge makes puppets of your  larger desires Though its hands are silken its heart  is of iron It lulls you to sleep only to stand by  your bed jeer at dignity of  flesh It makes mock of your sound senses  lays them in thistledown like fragile  vessels Verily lust for comfort murders  the passion of soul then walks  grinning in funeral But you children of space you restless  in rest you shall not be trapped nor  tamed Your house shall be not anchor but  mast It shall not be glistening film that  covers wound but eyelid that  guards eye You shall not fold your wings that you  may pass through doors nor bend your  heads that they strike not against  ceiling nor fear to breathe lest walls  should crack fall down You shall not dwell in tombs made by  dead for living And though of magnificence  splendour your house shall not hold  your secret nor shelter your longing For that which is boundless in you  abides in mansion of sky whose  door is morning mist whose  windows are songs silences  of night And weaver said Speak to us of  Clothes And he answered Your clothes conceal much of your  beauty yet they hide not  unbeautiful And though you seek in garments  freedom of privacy you may find in them  a harness chain Would that you could meet sun  the wind with more of your skin less  of your raiment For breath of life is in  sunlight hand of life is in  wind Some of you say It is north wind  who has woven clothes we wear And I say Ay it was north wind But shame was his loom  softening of sinews was his thread And when his work was done he laughed in  the forest Forget not that modesty  is for shield against eye of  unclean And when unclean shall be no more what were modesty but fetter  fouling of mind And forget not that earth delights  to feel your bare feet winds  long to play with your hair And merchant said Speak to us of  Buying Selling And he answered said To you earth yields her fruit  you shall not want if you but know how  to fill your hands It is in exchanging gifts of  earth that you shall find abundance  be satisfied Yet unless exchange be in love  kindly justice it will but lead some to  greed others to hunger When in market place you toilers of  the sea fields vineyards meet  the weavers potters  gatherers of spices Invoke then master spirit of  earth to come into your midst  sanctify scales reckoning  that weighs value against value And  suffer not barren handed to take  part in your transactions who would  sell their words for your labour To such men you should say Come with us to field or go with  our brothers to sea cast your  net For land sea shall be  bountiful to you even as to us And if there come singers  dancers flute players buy of  their gifts also For they too are gatherers of fruit  frankincense that which they bring though fashioned of dreams is raiment  and food for your soul And before you leave market place see that no one has gone his way with  empty hands For master spirit of earth shall  not sleep peacefully upon wind  till needs of least of you are  satisfied Then one of judges of city  stood forth said Speak to us of  Crime Punishment And he answered saying It is when your spirit goes wandering  upon wind That you alone unguarded commit  a wrong unto others therefore unto  yourself And for that wrong committed must you  knock wait while unheeded at  gate of blessed Like ocean is your god self It remains for ever undefiled And like ether it lifts but  winged Even like sun is your god self It knows not ways of mole nor  seeks it holes of serpent But your god self dwells not alone  in your being Much in you is still man much in  you is not yet man But shapeless pigmy that walks asleep  in mist searching for its own  awakening And of man in you would I now speak For it is he not your god self nor  the pigmy in mist that knows crime  and punishment of crime Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one  who commits wrong as though he were  not one of you but stranger unto you  and intruder upon your world But I say that even as holy  righteous cannot rise beyond highest  which is in each one of you So wicked weak cannot fall  lower than lowest which is in you  also And as single leaf turns not yellow  but with silent knowledge of  whole tree So wrong doer cannot  do wrong without hidden will of you  all Like procession you walk together  towards your god self Illustration You are way wayfarers And when one of you falls down he falls  for those behind him caution against  the stumbling stone Ay he falls for those ahead of him who though faster surer of foot yet  removed not stumbling stone And this also though word lie heavy  upon your hearts The murdered is not unaccountable for  his own murder And robbed is not blameless in being  robbed The righteous is not innocent of  deeds of wicked And white handed is not clean in  doings of felon Yea guilty is oftentimes victim  of injured And still more often condemned is  the burden bearer for guiltless  and unblamed You cannot separate just from  unjust good from wicked For they stand together before face  of sun even as black thread  the white are woven together And when black thread breaks  weaver shall look into whole cloth and he shall examine loom also If any of you would bring to judgment  the unfaithful wife Let him also weigh heart of her  husband in scales measure his soul  with measurements And let him who would lash offender  look unto spirit of offended And if any of you would punish in  name of righteousness lay ax  unto evil tree let him see to its  roots And verily he will find roots of  good bad fruitful  fruitless all entwined together in  the silent heart of earth And you judges who would be just What judgment pronounce you upon him  who though honest in flesh yet is  thief in spirit What penalty lay you upon him who slays  in flesh yet is himself slain in  spirit And how prosecute you him who in action  is deceiver oppressor Yet who also is aggrieved outraged And how shall you punish those whose  remorse is already greater than their  misdeeds Is not remorse justice which is  administered by that very law which you  would fain serve Yet you cannot lay remorse upon  innocent nor lift it from heart of  the guilty Unbidden shall it call in night that men may wake gaze upon  themselves And you who would  understand justice how shall you unless  you look upon all deeds in fullness  of light Only then shall you know that erect  and fallen are but one man standing  in twilight between night of his  pigmy self day of his god self And that corner stone of temple  is not higher than lowest stone in  its foundation Then lawyer said But what of our  Laws master And he answered You delight in laying down laws Yet you delight more in breaking them Like children playing by ocean who  build sand towers with constancy  then destroy them with laughter But while you build your sand towers  ocean brings more sand to shore And when you destroy them ocean  laughs with you Verily ocean laughs always with  innocent But what of those to whom life is not  an ocean man made laws are not  sand towers But to whom life is rock law  a chisel with which they would carve it  in their own likeness What of  cripple who hates dancers What of ox who loves his yoke  deems elk deer of forest  stray vagrant things What of old serpent who cannot shed  his skin calls all others naked  shameless And of him who comes early to  wedding feast when over fed  tired goes his way saying that all  feasts are violation all feasters  lawbreakers What shall I say of these save that  they too stand in sunlight but with  their backs to sun They see only their shadows their  shadows are their laws And what is sun to them but caster  of shadows And what is it to acknowledge  laws but to stoop down trace their  shadows upon earth But you who walk facing sun what  images drawn on earth can hold  you You who travel with wind what  weather vane shall direct your course What man s law shall bind you if you  break your yoke but upon no man s prison  door What laws shall you fear if you dance  but stumble against no man s iron  chains And who is he that shall bring you to  judgment if you tear off your garment  yet leave it in no man s path People of Orphalese you can muffle  drum you can loosen strings  of lyre but who shall command  skylark not to sing And orator said Speak to us of  Freedom And he answered At city gate by your fireside  I have seen you prostrate yourself  worship your own freedom Even as slaves humble themselves before  a tyrant praise him though he slays  them Ay in grove of temple in  the shadow of citadel I have seen  the freest among you wear their freedom  as yoke handcuff And my heart bled within me for you  can only be free when even desire  of seeking freedom becomes harness  to you when you cease to speak of  freedom as goal fulfilment You shall be free indeed when your  days are not without care nor your  nights without want grief But rather when these things girdle your  life yet you rise above them naked  and unbound And how shall you rise beyond your days  and nights unless you break  chains which you at dawn of your  understanding have fastened around your  noon hour In truth that which you call freedom is  the strongest of these chains though  its links glitter in sun dazzle  your eyes And what is it but fragments of your  own self you would discard that you may  become free If it is unjust law you would  abolish that law was written with your  own hand upon your own forehead You cannot erase it by burning your law  books nor by washing foreheads of  your judges though you pour sea  upon them And if it is despot you would  dethrone see first that his throne  erected within you is destroyed For how can tyrant rule free  the proud but for tyranny in their  own freedom shame in their own  pride And if it is care you would cast off that cart has been chosen by you rather  than imposed upon you And if it is fear you would dispel the seat of that fear is in your heart  and not in hand of feared Verily all things move within your being  in constant half embrace desired  and dreaded repugnant  cherished pursued that which  you would escape These things move within you as lights  and shadows in pairs that cling And when shadow fades is no  more light that lingers becomes  shadow to another light And thus your freedom when it loses its  fetters becomes itself fetter of  greater freedom And priestess spoke again  and said Speak to us of Reason  Passion And he answered saying Your soul is oftentimes battlefield upon which your reason your judgment  wage war against your passion your  appetite Would that I could be peacemaker in  your soul that I might turn discord  and rivalry of your elements into  oneness melody But how shall I unless you yourselves  be also peacemakers nay lovers  of all your elements Your reason your passion are  rudder sails of your seafaring  soul If either your sails or your rudder be  broken you can but toss drift or else be held at standstill in  mid seas For reason ruling alone is force confining passion unattended is flame that burns to its  own destruction Therefore let your soul exalt your  reason to height of passion that it  may sing And let it direct your passion with  reason that your passion may live  through its own daily resurrection and like phoenix rise above its own  ashes I would have you consider your judgment  and your appetite even as you would two  loved guests in your house Surely you would not honour one guest  above other for he who is more  mindful of one loses love  faith of both  Among hills when you sit in  cool shade of white poplars sharing  the peace serenity of distant fields  and meadows then let your heart say in  silence God rests in reason And when storm comes  mighty wind shakes forest and thunder lightning proclaim  majesty of sky then let your heart  say in awe God moves in passion And since you are breath in God s  sphere leaf in God s forest you  too should rest in reason move in  passion And woman spoke saying Tell us  of Pain And he said Your pain is breaking of shell  that encloses your understanding Even as stone of fruit must  break that its heart may stand in  sun so must you know pain And could you keep your heart in wonder  at daily miracles of your life your  pain would not seem less wondrous than  your joy And you would accept seasons of your  heart even as you have always accepted  the seasons that pass over your fields And you would watch with serenity  through winters of your grief Much of your pain is self chosen It is bitter potion by which  physician within you heals your sick  self Therefore trust physician drink  his remedy in silence tranquillity For his hand though heavy hard is  guided by tender hand of Unseen And cup he brings though it burn  your lips has been fashioned of  clay which Potter has moistened with  His own sacred tears And man said Speak to us of  Self Knowledge And he answered saying Your hearts know in silence secrets  of days nights But your ears thirst for sound of  your heart s knowledge You would know in words that which you  have always known in thought You would touch with your fingers  naked body of your dreams And it is well you should The hidden well spring of your soul must  needs rise run murmuring to sea And treasure of your infinite depths  would be revealed to your eyes But let there be no scales to weigh your  unknown treasure And seek not depths of your  knowledge with staff or sounding  line For self is sea boundless  measureless Say not I have found truth but  rather I have found truth Say not I have found path of  soul Say rather I have met soul  walking upon my path For soul walks upon all paths The soul walks not upon line neither  does it grow like reed The soul unfolds itself like lotus of  countless petals Illustration  Then said teacher Speak to us of  Teaching And he said No man can reveal to you aught but that  which already lies half asleep in  dawning of your knowledge The teacher who walks in shadow of  the temple among his followers gives  not of his wisdom but rather of his  faith his lovingness If he is indeed wise he does not bid  you enter house of his wisdom but  rather leads you to threshold of  your own mind The astronomer may speak to you of his  understanding of space but he cannot  give you his understanding The musician may sing to you of  rhythm which is in all space but he  cannot give you ear which arrests  the rhythm nor voice that echoes it And he who is versed in science  of numbers can tell of regions  of weight measure but he cannot  conduct you thither For vision of one man lends not its  wings to another man And even as each one of you stands alone  in God s knowledge so must each one of  you be alone in his knowledge of God  in his understanding of earth And youth said Speak to us of  Friendship And he answered saying Your friend is your needs answered He is your field which you sow with love  and reap with thanksgiving And he is your board your fireside For you come to him with your hunger and you seek him for peace When your friend speaks his mind you  fear not nay in your own mind nor  do you withhold ay And when he is silent your heart ceases  not to listen to his heart For without words in friendship all  thoughts all desires all expectations  are born shared with joy that is  unacclaimed When you part from your friend you  grieve not For that which you love most in him  may be clearer in his absence as  mountain to climber is clearer  from plain And let there be no  purpose in friendship save deepening  of spirit For love that seeks aught but  disclosure of its own mystery is not  love but net cast forth only  unprofitable is caught And let your best be for your friend If he must know ebb of your tide let him know its flood also For what is your friend that you should  seek him with hours to kill Seek him always with hours to live For it is his to fill your need but not  your emptiness And in sweetness of friendship  let there be laughter sharing of  pleasures For in dew of little things  the heart finds its morning is  refreshed And then scholar said Speak of  Talking And he answered saying You talk when you cease to be at peace  with your thoughts And when you can no longer dwell in  solitude of your heart you live in your  lips sound is diversion  pastime And in much of your talking thinking is  half murdered For thought is bird of space that in  a cage of words may indeed unfold its  wings but cannot fly There are those among you who seek  talkative through fear of being alone The silence of aloneness reveals to  their eyes their naked selves they  would escape And there are those who talk  without knowledge or forethought reveal  a truth which they themselves do not  understand And there are those who have truth  within them but they tell it not in  words In bosom of such as these spirit  dwells in rhythmic silence When you meet your friend on  roadside or in market place let  spirit in you move your lips direct  your tongue Let voice within your voice speak to  the ear of his ear For his soul will keep truth of  your heart as taste of wine is  remembered  When colour is forgotten  vessel is no more And astronomer said Master what  of Time And he answered You would measure time measureless  and immeasurable You would adjust your conduct  even direct course of your spirit  according to hours seasons Of time you would make stream upon  whose bank you would sit watch its  flowing Yet timeless in you is aware of  life s timelessness And knows that yesterday is but today s  memory tomorrow is today s dream And that that which sings  contemplates in you is still dwelling  within bounds of that first moment  which scattered stars into space Who among you does not feel that his  power to love is boundless And yet who does not feel that very  love though boundless encompassed  within centre of his being  moving not from love thought to love  thought nor from love deeds to other  love deeds And is not time even as love is undivided paceless But if in your thought you must measure  time into seasons let each season  encircle all other seasons And let today embrace past with  remembrance future with longing And one of elders of city  said Speak to us of Good Evil And he answered Of good in you I can speak but not  of evil For what is evil but good tortured by  its own hunger thirst Verily when good is hungry it seeks food  even in dark caves when it thirsts  it drinks even of dead waters You are good when you are one with  yourself Yet when you are not one with yourself  you are not evil For divided house is not den of  thieves it is only divided house And ship without rudder may wander  aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink  not to bottom You are good when  you strive to give of yourself Yet you are not evil when you seek gain  for yourself For when you strive for gain you are  but root that clings to earth  sucks at her breast Surely fruit cannot say to root Be like me ripe full ever  giving of your abundance For to fruit giving is need as  receiving is need to root You are good when you are fully awake in  your speech Yet you are not evil when you sleep  while your tongue staggers without  purpose And even stumbling speech may strengthen  a weak tongue You are good when you walk to your goal  firmly with bold steps Yet you are not evil when you go thither  limping Even those who limp go not  backward But you who are strong swift see  that you do not limp before lame deeming it kindness You are good in countless ways you  are not evil when you are not good You are only loitering sluggard Pity that stags cannot teach  swiftness to turtles In your longing for your giant self lies  your goodness that longing is in  all of you But in some of you that longing is  torrent rushing with might to sea carrying secrets of hillsides  and songs of forest And in others it is flat stream that  loses itself in angles bends  lingers before it reaches shore But let not him who longs much say to  him who longs little Wherefore are  you slow halting For truly good ask not naked Where is your garment nor  houseless What has befallen your  house Then priestess said Speak to us  of Prayer And he answered saying You pray in your distress in your  need would that you might pray also  in fullness of your joy in your  days of abundance For what is prayer but expansion of  yourself into living ether And if it is for your comfort to pour  your darkness into space it is also for  your delight to pour forth dawning  of your heart And if you cannot but weep when your  soul summons you to prayer she should  spur you again yet again though  weeping until you shall come laughing When you pray you rise to meet in  air those who are praying at that very  hour whom save in prayer you  may not meet Therefore let your visit to that temple  invisible be for naught but ecstasy  sweet communion For if you should enter temple for  no other purpose than asking you shall  not receive And if you should enter into it to  humble yourself you shall not be lifted Or even if you should enter into it to  beg for good of others you shall not  be heard It is enough that you enter temple  invisible I cannot teach you how to pray in words God listens not to your words save when  He Himself utters them through your  lips And I cannot teach you prayer of  seas forests mountains But you who are born of  mountains forests seas  can find their prayer in your heart And if you but listen in stillness  of night you shall hear them saying  in silence Our God who art our winged self it is  thy will in us that willeth It is thy desire in us that desireth It is thy urge in us that would turn our  nights which are thine into days which  are thine also We cannot ask thee for aught for thou  knowest our needs before they are born  in us Thou art our need in giving us more  of thyself thou givest us all Illustration  Then hermit who visited city  once year came forth said Speak  to us of Pleasure And he answered saying Pleasure is freedom song But it is not freedom It is blossoming of your desires But it is not their fruit It is depth calling unto height But it is not deep nor high It is caged taking wing But it is not space encompassed Ay in very truth pleasure is  freedom song And I fain would have you sing it with  fullness of heart yet I would not have  you lose your hearts in singing Some of your youth seek pleasure as if  it were all they are judged  rebuked I would not judge nor  rebuke them I would have them seek For they shall find pleasure but not  her alone Seven are her sisters least of  them is more beautiful than pleasure Have you not heard of man who was  digging in earth for roots found  a treasure And some of your elders remember  pleasures with regret like wrongs  committed in drunkenness But regret is beclouding of mind  and not its chastisement They should remember their pleasures  with gratitude as they would  harvest of summer Yet if it comforts them to regret let  them be comforted And there are among you those who  are neither young to seek nor old to  remember And in their fear of seeking  remembering they shun all pleasures lest they neglect spirit or offend  against it But even in their foregoing is their  pleasure And thus they too find treasure though  they dig for roots with quivering hands But tell me who is he that can offend  the spirit Shall nightingale offend  stillness of night or firefly  the stars And shall your flame or your smoke  burden wind Think you spirit is still pool  which you can trouble with staff Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure  you do but store desire in  recesses of your being Who knows but that which seems omitted  today waits for tomorrow Even your body knows its heritage  and its rightful need will not be  deceived And your body is harp of your soul And it is yours to bring forth sweet  music from it or confused sounds And now you ask in your heart How  shall we distinguish that which is  good in pleasure from that which is not  good Go to your fields your gardens  you shall learn that it is pleasure  of bee to gather honey of  flower But it is also pleasure of  flower to yield its honey to bee For to bee flower is fountain of  life And to flower bee is messenger  of love And to both bee flower giving  and receiving of pleasure is need  and ecstasy People of Orphalese be in your  pleasures like flowers bees And poet said Speak to us of  Beauty And he answered Where shall you seek beauty how  shall you find her unless she herself be  your way your guide And how shall you speak of her except  she be weaver of your speech The aggrieved injured say Beauty is kind gentle Like young mother half shy of her own  glory she walks among us And passionate say Nay beauty is  a thing of might dread Like tempest she shakes earth  beneath us sky above us The tired weary say Beauty is  of soft whisperings She speaks in our  spirit Her voice yields to our  silences like faint light that quivers  in fear of shadow But restless say We have heard her  shouting among mountains And with her cries came sound of  hoofs beating of wings  roaring of lions At night watchmen of city say Beauty shall rise with dawn from  the east And at noontide toilers  wayfarers say We have seen her leaning  over earth from windows of  sunset In winter say snow bound She shall  come with spring leaping upon  hills And in summer heat reapers  say We have seen her dancing with  autumn leaves we saw drift of  snow in her hair All these things  have you said of beauty Yet in truth you spoke not of her but of  needs unsatisfied And beauty is not need but ecstasy It is not mouth thirsting nor empty  hand stretched forth But rather heart enflamed soul  enchanted It is not image you would see nor  the song you would hear But rather image you see though you  close your eyes song you hear  though you shut your ears It is not sap within furrowed  bark nor wing attached to claw But rather garden for ever in bloom  and flock of angels for ever in  flight People of Orphalese beauty is life when  life unveils her holy face But you are life you are veil Beauty is eternity gazing at itself  in mirror But you are eternity you are  mirror And old priest said Speak to us  of Religion And he said Have I spoken this day of aught else Is not religion all deeds all  reflection And that which is neither deed nor  reflection but wonder surprise  ever springing in soul even while  the hands hew stone or tend  loom Who can separate his faith from  his actions or his belief from his  occupations Who can spread his hours before him saving This for God this for  myself This for my soul this other  for my body All your hours are wings that beat  through space from self to self He  who wears his morality but as his best  garment were better naked The wind sun will tear no holes  in his skin And he who defines his conduct by ethics  imprisons his song bird in cage The freest song comes not through bars  and wires And he to whom worshipping is window to open but also to shut has not yet  visited house of his soul whose  windows are from dawn to dawn Your daily life is your temple your  religion Whenever you enter into it take with you  your all Take plough forge  mallet lute The things you have fashioned in  necessity or for delight For in revery you cannot rise above your  achievements nor fall lower than your  failures And take with you all men For in  adoration you cannot fly higher than  their hopes nor humble yourself lower  than their despair And if you would know God be not  therefore solver of riddles Rather look about you you shall see  Him playing with your children And look into space you shall see Him  walking in cloud outstretching His  arms in lightning descending in  rain You shall see Him smiling in flowers then rising waving His hands in  trees Then Almitra spoke saying We would  ask now of Death And he said You would know secret of death But how shall you find it unless you  seek it in heart of life The owl whose night bound eyes are blind  unto day cannot unveil mystery  of light If you would indeed behold spirit  of death open your heart wide unto  body of life For life death are one even as  river sea are one In depth of your hopes desires  lies your silent knowledge of  beyond And like seeds dreaming beneath snow  your heart dreams of spring Trust dreams for in them is hidden  the gate to eternity Your fear  of death is but trembling of  shepherd when he stands before king  whose hand is to be laid upon him in  honour Is shepherd not joyful beneath his  trembling that he shall wear mark  of king Yet is he not more mindful of his  trembling For what is it to die but to stand naked  in wind to melt into sun And what is it to cease breathing but  to free breath from its restless  tides that it may rise expand  seek God unencumbered Only when you drink from river of  silence shall you indeed sing And when you have reached mountain  top then you shall begin to climb And when earth shall claim your  limbs then shall you truly dance And now it was evening And Almitra seeress said Blessed be  this day this place your spirit  that has spoken And he answered Was it I who spoke Was  I not also listener Then he descended steps of  Temple all people followed him And he reached his ship stood upon  the deck And facing people again he raised  his voice said People of Orphalese wind bids me  leave you Less hasty am I than wind yet I  must go We wanderers ever seeking lonelier  way begin no day where we have ended  another day no sunrise finds us  where sunset left us Even while  earth sleeps we travel We are seeds of tenacious  plant it is in our ripeness our  fullness of heart that we are given to  the wind are scattered Brief were my days among you  briefer still words I have spoken But should my voice fade in your ears and my love vanish in your memory then  I will come again And with richer heart lips more  yielding to spirit will I speak Yea I shall return with tide And though death may hide me  greater silence enfold me yet again  will I seek your understanding And not in vain will I seek If aught I have said is truth that  truth shall reveal itself in clearer  voice in words more kin to your  thoughts I go with wind people of  Orphalese but not down into emptiness And if this day is not fulfilment  of your needs my love then let it  be promise till another day Man s needs change but not his love nor his desire that his love should  satisfy his needs Know therefore that from greater  silence I shall return The mist that drifts away at dawn leaving but dew in fields shall  rise gather into cloud then  fall down in rain And not unlike mist have I been In stillness of night I have  walked in your streets my spirit  has entered your houses And your heart beats were in my heart and your breath was upon my face I  knew you all Ay I knew your joy your pain and in your sleep your dreams were my  dreams And oftentimes I was among you lake  among mountains I mirrored summits in you  bending slopes even  passing flocks of your thoughts your  desires And to my silence came laughter  of your children in streams  longing of your youths in rivers And when they reached my depth  streams rivers ceased not yet to  sing Illustration But sweeter still than laughter  greater than longing came to me It was boundless in you The vast man in whom you are all but  cells sinews He in whose chant all your singing is  but soundless throbbing It is in vast man that you are vast And in beholding him that I beheld you  and loved you For what distances can love reach that  are not in that vast sphere What visions what expectations what  presumptions can outsoar that flight Like giant oak tree covered with apple  blossoms is vast man in you His  might binds you to earth his  fragrance lifts you into space in  his durability you are deathless You have been told that even like  chain you are as weak as your weakest  link This is but half truth You are also  as strong as your strongest link To measure you by your smallest deed  is to reckon power of ocean by  frailty of its foam To judge you by your failures is to  cast blame upon seasons for their  inconstancy Ay you are like ocean And though heavy grounded ships await  the tide upon your shores yet even  like ocean you cannot hasten your  tides And like seasons you are also And though in your winter you deny your  spring Yet spring reposing within you smiles  in her drowsiness is not offended Think not I say these things in  order that you may say one to  other He praised us well He saw but  the good in us I only speak to you in words of that  which you yourselves know in thought And what is word knowledge but shadow  of wordless knowledge Your thoughts my words are waves  from sealed memory that keeps records  of our yesterdays And of ancient days when earth  knew not us nor herself And of nights when earth was up wrought  with confusion Wise men have come to you to give you  of their wisdom I came to take of your  wisdom And behold I have found that which is  greater than wisdom It is flame spirit in you ever  gathering more of itself While you heedless of its expansion bewail withering of your days It is life in quest of life in  bodies that fear grave There are no graves here These mountains plains are cradle  and stepping stone Whenever you pass by field where  you have laid your ancestors look well  thereupon you shall see yourselves  and your children dancing hand in hand Verily you often make merry without  knowing Others have come to you to whom for  golden promises made unto your faith  you have given but riches power  glory Less than promise have I given  yet more generous have you been to me You have given me my deeper thirsting  after life Surely there is no greater gift to man  than that which turns all his aims  into parching lips all life into  fountain Illustration And in this lies my honour my  reward That whenever I come to fountain  to drink I find living water itself  thirsty And it drinks me while I drink it Some of you have deemed me proud  over shy to receive gifts Too proud indeed am I to receive wages but not gifts And though I have eaten berries among  the hills when you would have had me sit  at your board And slept in portico of temple  when you would gladly have sheltered me Yet was it not your loving mindfulness  of my days my nights that made food  sweet to my mouth girdled my sleep  with visions For this I bless you most You give much know not that you give  at all Verily kindness that  gazes upon itself in mirror turns to  stone And good deed that calls itself by  tender names becomes parent to  curse And some of you have called me aloof and drunk with my own aloneness And you have said He holds council  with trees of forest but not  with men He sits alone on hill tops looks  down upon our city True it is that I have climbed hills  and walked in remote places How could I have seen you save from  great height or great distance How can one be indeed near unless he be  tar And others among you called unto me not  in words they said Stranger stranger lover of  unreachable heights why dwell you among  the summits where eagles build  their nests Why seek you  unattainable What storms would you trap in your net And what vaporous birds do you hunt in  the sky Come be one of us Descend appease your hunger with our  bread quench your thirst with our  wine In solitude of their souls they said  these things But were their solitude deeper they  would have known that I sought but  secret of your joy your pain And I hunted only your larger selves  that walk sky But hunter was also hunted For many of my arrows left my bow only  to seek my own breast And flier was also creeper For when my wings were spread in  sun their shadow upon earth was  turtle And I believer was also doubter For often have I put my finger  in my own wound that I might have  greater belief in you greater  knowledge of you And it is with this belief this  knowledge that I say You are not enclosed within your bodies nor confined to houses or fields That which is you dwells above  mountain roves with wind It is not thing that crawls into  the sun for warmth or digs holes into  darkness for safety But thing free spirit that envelops  the earth moves in ether If these be vague words then seek not  to clear them Vague nebulous is beginning of  all things but not their end And I fain would have you remember me as  a beginning Life all that lives is conceived  in mist not in crystal And who knows but crystal is mist  in decay This would I have you remember in  remembering me That which seems most feeble  bewildered in you is strongest  most determined Is it not your breath that has erected  and hardened structure of your  bones And is it not dream which none of you  remember having dreamt that builded  your city fashioned all there is in  it Could you but see tides of that  breath you would cease to see all else And if you could hear whispering of  the dream you would hear no other sound But you do not see nor do you hear  it is well The veil that clouds your eyes shall be  lifted by hands that wove it And clay that fills your ears shall  be pierced by those fingers that kneaded  it And you shall see And you shall hear Yet you shall not deplore having known  blindness nor regret having been deaf For in that day you shall know  hidden purposes in all things And you shall bless darkness as you  would bless light After saying these things he looked  about him he saw pilot of his  ship standing by helm gazing  now at full sails now at  distance And he said Patient over patient is captain of  my ship The wind blows restless are  sails Even rudder begs direction Yet quietly my captain awaits my  silence And these my mariners who have heard  the choir of greater sea they too  have heard me patiently Now they  shall wait no longer I am ready The stream has reached sea  once more great mother holds her son  against her breast Fare you well people of Orphalese This day has ended It is closing upon us even as  water lily upon its own tomorrow What was given us here we shall keep And if it suffices not then again must  we come together together stretch  our hands unto giver Forget not that I shall come back to  you A little while my longing shall  gather dust foam for another body A little while moment of rest upon  the wind another woman shall bear  me Farewell to you youth I have  spent with you It was but yesterday we met in  dream You have sung to me in my  aloneness I of your longings have  built tower in sky But now our sleep has fled our dream  is over it is no longer dawn The noontide is upon us our half  waking has turned to fuller day we  must part If in twilight of memory we should  meet once more we shall speak again  together you shall sing to me  deeper song And if our hands should meet in another  dream we shall build another tower in  the sky So saying he made signal to  seamen straightway they weighed  anchor cast ship loose from its  moorings they moved eastward And cry came from people as from  single heart it rose into dusk  and was carried out over sea like  great trumpeting Only Almitra was silent gazing after  the ship until it had vanished into  the mist And when all people were dispersed  she still stood alone upon sea wall remembering in her heart his saying A little while moment of rest upon  the wind another woman shall bear  me Illustration End of Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran  END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PROPHET  This file should be named txt or zip This all associated
