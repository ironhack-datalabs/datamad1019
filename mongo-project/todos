## TODO's
​
You recently created a new company in the `GAMING industry`. The company will have the following scheme:
​
- 20 Designers
- 5 UI/UX Engineers
- 10 Frontend Developers
- 15 Data Engineers
- 5 Backend Developers
- 20 Account Managers
- 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
- 10 Executives
- 1 CEO/President
​
As a data engineer you have asked all the employees to show their preferences on where to place the new office.
Your goal is to place the **new company offices** in the best place for the company to grow.
You have to found a place that more or less covers all the following requirements.
Note that **it's impossible to cover all requirements**, so you have to prioritize at your glance.
​
- Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
- 30% of the company have at least 1 child.
- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.
- Account managers need to travel a lot
- All people in the company have between 25 and 40 years, give them some place to go to party.
- Nobody in the company likes to have companies with more than 10 years in a radius of 2 KM.
- The CEO is Vegan
​
## Help
​
- Geospatial range Queries in MongoDB with `pymongo`
- GeoJSON Point `{ type: "Point", coordinates: [ 40, 5 ] }`
- Create sphere2d index in python with pymongo: `db.collection.createIndex( { <location field> : "2dsphere" } )`
- Query `$near` operator: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/near/#op._S_near
​
## How to deliver the project
​
- You must justify your decision with tableau slides. Provide us the public tableau link inside a README.md
  file at dir `module-2/project-mongodb-geospartial-queries`.
- Provide `lat` and `long` for the new office proposals.
