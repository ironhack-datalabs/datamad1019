# Lab | Hypothesis Testing

## Introduction

In `main.ipynb` we'll familiarize you with one sample hypothesis tests. You will write Python code to conduct one sample hypothesis tests as well as construct confidence intervals.

If you are interested in dive deeper into hypothesis tests, you can complete `bonus.ipynb` where you will learn about two types of t-tests: Student's t- and Paired t- tests. We touched t-tests in the Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Significance lesson but did not go into details. You'll learn about t-test in the upcoming lesson Two Sample Hypothesis Tests with Scipy.

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` (required)
- `bonus.ipynb` (optional)

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
