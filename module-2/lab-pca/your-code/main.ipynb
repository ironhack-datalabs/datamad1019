While we have not worked much with image data before, it can be represented as a numpy array where each pixel is assigned a numeric value. In this lesson, we will look at a dataset of cats and a dataset of dogs and see whether reducing them to two dimensions allows us to see if the data is separable. We will start by loading and processing the data. Run the cell below to load the two csv files and convert them into numpy arrays."
