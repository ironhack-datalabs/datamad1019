# Lab | Introduction to Apache Spark

## Introduction

In the Apache Spark lesson you learned about the concepts and architecture of Spark. You may also have installed PySpark in local mode on your computer. In this lab, you'll test your PySpark installation in Jupyter Notebook. In addition, you will also deploy Spark in cluster mode with Databricks then create a Jupyter Notebook.

### Objectives

* Complete a data analysis demo with PySpark.
* Deploy PySpark cluster mode with Databricks.
* Create a Jupyter Notebook and publish it in Databricks.

## Getting Started

If you have installed Spark in the local mode on your computer, please take both Challenge 1 and 2. If you did not install Spark local mode, you can skip Challenge 1 and go directly to Challenge 2.

## Deliverables

- `challenge-1.ipynb`.
- Published Databricks Jupyter Notebook for Challenge 2.

## Submission

* Submit `challenge-1.ipynb` with your solutions via git.
* Submit the link to your published Notebook in a text file.
